# EcoFusion

We propose a dynamic marketplace designed to tackle climate challenges holistically, addressing the problem from its root causes to its broader impacts. This platform will connect innovators with net-zero emissions projects to industries responsible for significant emissions.

It will enable a decentralized and transparent trading of pollutants like soot with Hedera blockchain while providing pathways for transforming waste into sustainable, beneficial products for society. It also serve to bring change makers together.
