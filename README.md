# EcoFusion

We propose a dynamic marketplace designed to tackle climate challenges holistically, addressing the problem from its root causes to its broader impacts. This platform will connect innovators with net-zero emissions projects to industries responsible for significant emissions.

It will enable a decentralized and transparent trading of pollutants like soot with Hedera blockchain while providing pathways for transforming waste into sustainable, beneficial products for society. It also serve to bring change makers together.

## Key features

#### Waste-to-Product Marketplace

The platform allows users to buy and sell waste materials (plastics, organic waste, industrial by-products) to be transformed into sustainable products.

#### Crowdfunding for Green Project

The platform enables green innovation funding in $HBAR, ensuring that all contributions support verified, impactful projects. Hedera's secure framework creates a trust-driven marketplace for eco-conscious investors.

#### Leaderboard for Social Impact

Users can track and compare their impact on sustainability with others, including carbon offset efforts, waste recycling, and biodegradable solutions via a public leaderboard.

#### Investor and Changemaker Connections

The platform allows investors to connect with changemakers working on climate-positive solutions, facilitating easy collaboration and funding.
